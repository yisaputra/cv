I am a composer, a session keyboardist, and a music educator from Indonesia. I came from a very musical family. My father is a music teacher and my mother was a worship leader at our local church. I took up classical piano around the age of 11 while keep playing Christian contemporary music at church.

​

I soon find a passion for composing and for orchestral music, but I could not find any places in my hometown where I can compose for an orchestra. So I decided to found my very own mini-orchestra in my high school in SMAK Penabur Gading Serpong, Indonesia that we called CAMEN Orchestra (still exist until now), where I got to write all the music we played as well as the opportunity to conduct it, despite lack of formal training in both disciplines. But I was not waiting for anybody to give me the opportunity I was dearly craved. I clearly took the matter into my own hand. The orchestra garnered a great response from the school and from the community. At one point, we performed in front of the Swedish Ambassador for Indonesia. That was high for “a make-believe conductor/composer,” or so I thought. But from the success of this endeavor, I’m convinced that I found my calling: Music.

​

I moved to the States in 2011. I was attending the University of Houston studying 21st-century composition under a scholarship. I also got a chance to play with the school’s Jazz Big Band Orchestra; a chance I’ve never had when I was in Indonesia. I have the most amazing year studying in Houston before life pulled me back into the dirt when I lost my mother who passed away from terminal cancer. The loss of my mother was quite devastating for me that I almost quit music altogether.


After two years of the recovery period, I was offered a full scholarship at Cornel School of Music to study under some of my musical idols, such as Otmaro Ruiz, Abraham Laboriel, and Jimmy Branly among others. It just started to take off from there. I started to perform in some iconic jazz venues around LA such as Blue Whale, Mambo’s Cafe, and House of Blues among others. Summer 2015, I went on to my first International Tour to Bermuda with HTG. I was placed as a Runner-Up of The International Six String Theory for Piano in 2016.

​

In 2017, I got a chance to be mentored by film composer Michael A. Levine and worked in his studio on numerous projects. I took a role as his technical assistant on a TV show, Siren. I also started to compose music for MPATH, Michael’s curated music library and later Alvani Tunes.

​

I am currently working on two albums, for MPATH, a boutique music library by Michael A. Levine and for Alvani Tunes. I am also currently busy with arrangements and co-producing projects. Whether it is strings or brass arrangement, or co-write with another artist.

​

As a composer, my recent TV placements includes Poldark (PBS) and Price of Fame (REELZ), among others. My music is currently distributed by APM (USA) and EMI Music (Worldwide).

​

As a session keyboardist, I’m playing for different local and international artists in the studio setting as well as on stage and venues around town. I have been a music director and has shared the stage with some International artists in Los Angeles such as Abraham Laboriel, Tommy Walker, Lea Simanjuntak, Katia Moraes, Junkie Munkie, Pongky Barata, Sophie Navita, Inul Daratista, Nia Daniaty, Hetty Koes Endang, Yosi Mokalu Project Pop, and Harvey Malaiholo among others.

​

When not composing and performing, I am passionate about teaching the next generation. A number of my students has won many regional and international competitions and has performed in the prestigious Carnegie Hall, New York.

​

I am passionate about my craft! Whether it is crafting music or crafting the next generation through elaborate music education. But despite that, to me music is a mere medium. A medium for me to connect to people and to help them get through their life. If my music can make people feel comforted, reassured, entertained, and even enraged to the point of clarity, I consider it: a mission accomplished.
